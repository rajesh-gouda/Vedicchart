## 🛠️ How It Works


Natal Chart Calculation: The application first uses your birth details (DOB, TOB, POB) to calculate your natal chart (Lagna chart) based on Vedic principles, determining the ascendant and planetary positions at your time of birth.

Transit Data: It then fetches the current planetary positions for the present day (Gochar).

Chart Generation: Using the Pillow library, it draws a North Indian style chart, placing your natal house numbers and the transiting planets within it.

Prediction Engine: The daily predictions are generated by interpreting the transit of key planets (especially the Moon) through the different houses of your natal chart and their relationships with your natal planets.
